### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Avantika Prativadhi, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computational and Data Sciences. I'm passionate about leveraging data to gain insights and make informed decisions.

I have a strong command of Python, R, SQL, and various data visualization tools, which I have used to analyze and interpret data, develop statistical models, and implement machine learning algorithms. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and expand my knowledge in the field of data science.

Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin!
